# Soulless


In Soulless, you play as a cube that has been stripped of his soul, and thus all of his senses and abilities. As you start off, the only thing you can do is move left and right. No jumping, shooting or climbing, you can't hear, and you can't even see. At this reduced state, you must brave all the challenges and retrieve the fragments of your stolen soul one by one, slowly regaining the ability to live again.
